# Scheduling-with-Genetic-Algorithms
Job Schedule allotment using Genetic Algorithms

The problem we are trying to solve is how to schedule a set of individuals, each with
availability and preferences, into a set of timeslots. The primary goal we have identified
is to produce a complete schedule for which every person is available for every shift
they have been assigned. The secondary goal is to meet as many of the personsâ€™
preferences as possible. These priorities are reflected in our fitness function.
